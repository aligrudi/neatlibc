NEATLIBC
========

Neatlibc is a small C standard library, supporting x86, x86_64, and
32-bit ARM architectures.  Written mainly for bootstrapping neatcc,
neatlibc does not implement many of the C standard library functions.
Nonetheless, most of the programs available in its homepage
(http://litcave.rudi.ir/) can be compiled with neatcc and neatlibc.

To examine dynamic memory allocation in a program, you can define
MEMTST macro before including stdlib.h header (only implemented for
x86_64).  It should report failed allocations, bad free() calls, and
memory leaks.
